# Chloride-concentrations-of-groundwater-and-rainfallall

The goal of these projects is the implementation of a full data analysis workflow using python with the combination of SQLite database persistence.

The subject of the projects focus on understanding of the relationship between chloride concentrations of groundwater and rainfall as well as region location, population, density in New Zealand.

The analysis workflow is illustrated in the following diagram

Data analysis document includes Data Acquisition, Wrangling, Itegration and Analysis.

Database design is to design a database (DB) schema that represents all the data that you have acquired from multiple sources in a normalised form, and to populate it using SQLite, thus achieving full data persistence.
